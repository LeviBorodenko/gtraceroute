gTraceroute is a powerful network diagnostic tool that combines the functionalities of traditional traceroute and the graphical user interface (GUI) approach of PingPlotter. Implemented in Python, gTraceroute offers a terminal user interface (TUI) that provides real-time route tracing with a rich set of features including historical RTT plotting, comprehensive hop information, and an intuitive interface for revisiting previous trace targets.
